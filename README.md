#Car Inventory CLI 🚗
This is a simple command-line interface (CLI) application for managing a car inventory. It allows users to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a list of cars. The application uses object-oriented principles in Java and includes a feature to save and load the inventory to a file, so your data is persistent between sessions.

#Features
Add a new car: Enter details like make, model, year, and a unique VIN.

View all cars: Display a list of all cars currently in the inventory.

Find a car: Search for a specific car using its VIN.

Remove a car: Delete a car from the inventory by its VIN.

Persistent storage: The car data is saved to a file (car_inventory.ser) and automatically loaded on startup.

# How to Run
Clone or download this repository.
